Content for the Advocacy Fund


Box 1:
It has become clear over the past several years that if we want to keep fighting for our EM family, we need additional funds to support these efforts and other issues that will come to the forefront in the future. For this reason, INACEP created an Advocacy Fund. The purpose of this fund is to support INACEPâ€™s efforts in fighting for those goals we all share as EM physicians. While the goal for 2024-2025 is centered around securing fair reimbursement, in the future this fund could also be used for other issues that arise, whether they are related to medical malpractice, boarding in the ED, the working relationship between EM physicians and other providers, or patient-care issues, just to name a few examples.


Box 2:
 To show our dedication to our advocacy efforts, INACEP made a significant donation to the newly created advocacy fund. We are asking that each of you consider supporting these efforts with your own donation. For individuals, we are asking for any amount that you feel able to give. For EM practice groups, we are asking that you consider making a donation of $0.05 / per patient for the number of patients your groups sees on average each year. Thank you in advance for your consideration in supporting the efforts of INACEP, and thank you for being a part of our EM family.
